XSPEC_EMCEE
-----------

This is a program to use emcee to do MCMC analyses of X-ray spectra in
xspec.

** Please acknowledge use of this code by Jeremy Sanders in any
publications. **

As described on their website, emcee is an extensible, pure-Python
implementation of of Goodman & Weare's Affine Invariant Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) Ensemble sampler.

REQUIREMENTS:

Python: Preferably 2.7 <= version < 3, but 2.5 or 2.6 should work
emcee: http://danfm.ca/emcee/
xspec: http://heasarc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/
argparse: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse (for Python < 2.7)

USAGE:

The program will run on an input XCM file (loading data+model). It
writes out an xspec-compatible chain file, plus a numpy data file. You
just need to choose the number of iterations, length of burn in period
and number of walkers. Remember that the for every iteration you get
the number of walkers points in the output chain file. The chains from
the walkers are flattened in the output .chain file.

The program can run multiple copies of xspec simultaneously. By
default it runs one copy on a local machine. You can run multiple
copies using --systems="localhost localhost", etc. locahost specifies
running on the local system. You can run remote copies over ssh by
using a different system name. Note that you will probably need to
edit start_xspec.sh for non-remote systems to run appropriate
initialisation files.

Xspec MCMC with EMCEE. Jeremy Sanders 2012.

positional arguments:
  XCM                  Input XCM file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --niters N           Number of iterations (default: 5000)
  --nburn N            Number of burn iterations (default: 500)
  --nwalkers N         Number of walkers (default: 50)
  --systems LIST       Space separated list of systems to run on (default:
                       localhost)
  --output-npz FILE    Output NPZ file (default: emcee.npz)
  --output-chain FILE  Output text file (default: emcee.chain)

TODO:
 - Write out chain file incrementally?
 - Use local xspec to find remote xspecs automatically?
